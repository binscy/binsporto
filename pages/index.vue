      <p>
        I am Radian Bintang, a bachelor of computer science student.
      </p>
      <p>My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.</p>
      <p>
        I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. You can see <nuxt-link to="projects">list of my projects here</nuxt-link>. I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happens through open-source and I am happy to see what I do could eventually feedback to the community and industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of programming, I enjoy reading books. I love the pleasure and excitement of gaining new knowledge other than programming from the books I read.
